<h1> Greedy Dog </h1>
<p align ="center"<font size=15> There was a dog that was very hungry.<br> He searched for food everywhere and at last he found a bone.
<br> He picked the bone with his mouth and started going back to his home.
<br> There was a bridge on the way to his home.
<br> When he started crossing it he saw his reflection in the water.<br> The dog thought that there was another dog with a bone in water.
<br> He wanted to get that other bone too.<br> So he started barking at his own reflection.<br> His bone fell in water as soon as he opened his mouth.
<br> The greedy dog lost his bone.<br></font></p>

<h1>The Thirsty Crow</h1>
<p align ="center"<font size=6>One hot day, a thirsty crow flew all over the fields looking for water.<br> For a long time, he could not find any. He felt very weak, almost lost all hope. Suddenly, he saw a water jug below the tree.<br> He flew straight down to see if there was any water inside. Yes, he could see some water inside the jug!<br>

The crow tried to push his head into the jug. Sadly, he found that the neck of the jug was too narrow.<br> Then he tried to push the jug to tilt for the water to flow out, but the jug was too heavy.<br>

The crow thought hard for a while. Then, looking around it, he saw some pebbles.<br> He suddenly had a good idea. He started picking up the pebbles one by one, dropping each into the jug.<br> As more and more pebbles filled the jug, the water level kept rising. Soon it was high enough for the crow to drink. His plan had worked!<br></font></p>

<h1>The Ant and The Dove</h1>
<p align ="center"<font size=6>On a hot day of summer, an ant was searching for some water. After walking around for some time, she came near the river. To drink the water, she climbed up on a small rock. While trying to drink a water, she slipped and fell into the river.<br>

There was a dove sitting on a branch of a tree who saw an ant falling into the river. The dove quickly plucked a leaf and dropped it into the river near the struggling ant.<br> The ant moved towards the leaf and climbed up onto it. Soon, the leaf drifted to dry ground, and the ant jumped out. She looked up to the tree and thanked the dove.<br>

Later, the same day, a bird catcher nearby was about to throw his net over the dove hoping to trap it. An ant saw him and guessed what he was about to do.<br> The dove was resting and he had no idea about the bird catcher. An ant quickly bit him on the foot. Feeling the pain, the bird catcher dropped his net and let out a light scream. The dove noticed it and quickly flew away.<br></font></p>
